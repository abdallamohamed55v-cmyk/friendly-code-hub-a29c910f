export const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "Can I change or cancel my plan anytime?",
    a: "Yes. From your Billing settings you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime. Upgrades are prorated and take effect immediately; downgrades and cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you keep full access until then.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between the 'unlimited window' and Megsy Credits (MC)?",
    a: "Chat with Megsy AI is unlimited at all times on every paid plan. Each paid plan also gives you an unlimited window for Images, Videos, Slides, Docs, Deep Research and Code Builder — 7 days/month on Pro, 15 days/month on Elite, and the full month on Business. MC is a separate balance used for premium usage and anything generated outside your unlimited window.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when I run out of MC?",
    a: "You can keep using Chat unlimited, and anything still inside your unlimited window (Images, Videos, Slides, Docs, Research and Code Builder). For premium usage or generations outside the window, you can top up MC anytime from Billing, or wait for your next renewal — MC refresh at the start of each billing cycle.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do unused credits roll over?",
    a: "No. Monthly MC reset at the start of each billing cycle and don't roll over. Yearly plans get bonus MC delivered upfront (Pro +480, Elite +1,000, Business +2,400) on top of saving roughly 2 months on price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do prices include tax?",
    a: "Prices are shown excluding tax. VAT/GST is calculated and added at checkout based on your billing country, and the final amount is shown before you confirm payment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer refunds?",
    a: "Yes — new paid subscriptions (Pro and above) include a 7-day no-questions-asked refund window, provided no more than 10% of your included credits have been consumed. Credit packs are non-refundable once any credit from the pack has been spent. Failed generations are auto-refunded within minutes. Email support@megsyai.com (subject: \"Refund Request\") and we respond within 5 business days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my payment secure? Which payment methods do you accept?",
    a: "All payments are processed by Dodo Payments, a PCI-DSS Level 1 merchant of record. Your card details never touch our servers. We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB, UnionPay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Amazon Pay and WeChat Pay, with 3-D Secure 2 on eligible transactions. Your bank statement will show \"DODO * MEGSY AI\".",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer team or enterprise plans?",
    a: "Yes. The Business plan includes unlimited team seats, SSO/SAML, dedicated infrastructure, a 99.9% SLA and a success manager. For custom MC allocation, custom contracts, volume discounts or API/integration needs, contact our enterprise team via the Enterprise page or support@megsyai.com.",
